It is black Friday and raining. We woke up to discover that the only coffee we had left was decaf, so obviously that needs fixing. Today I'm just roasting on our front porch. I'm roasting the last of the green coffee we picked up from Big Bend Coffee Roasters. We bought a couple pounds when we were out there, one decaf Mexican, and the one I'm roasting today, a fully caffeinated Peruvian called La ???.

I notice the thermostat, a little analog candy thermometer is already reading 500 degrees, meaning it is totally busted as it's probably only 50 degrees. I'll need to replace that already, which sucks as it's seen a couple of months of use.

Anyway, Jackie was a trooper and braved the rain to get a few shots of the roast.

I split the pound in half, as I wanted to learn how it roasts and not risk ruining all of this coffee. First crack didn't come in until about 5 minutes, and I had some trouble with the roast stalling out, and ended up pulling it at 12 minutes somewhere into second crack. It developed into a full-city plus.

I was a little relieved it didn't roast like the decaf last week. That stuff roasted _way_ too fast and I burnt the first half-pound, and got rid of it. I haven't had to do that in years. Anyway, we've been drinking enough coffee at home that I may start roasting a pound at a time. I'm pretty sure the Stovepop can handle it.

I decided to roast the second half, and this one finished at around 10 minutes, having the advantage of the preheating. I let this one roast a little faster and a little longer, going for a vienna, but I still ended up with a full-city. I guess I was still a little nervous from how unnaturally quick the decaf beans roasted, and was worried about burning it.

I think it came out pretty good. I'll have to report back on how it tastes.
